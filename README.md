# pacbot_simulation
To run: add python libraries Pygame and Schedule
  To do this, navigate to your Python folder in Terminal and run "python -m pip install libraryname", where libraryname is pygame or schedule.
Then, download repository and open in an IDE (Pycharm works great).
Run game.py and it will bring up a window with a simulation.
Update game.py and pacbot.py to respond to your code rather than keystrokes in order to autonomate.
